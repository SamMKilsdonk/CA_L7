This is lab 7 for computer acrchitecture.
The temporary top level module is in L7_PC_ID.v
This instantiates one instance of L7PC.v, the program counter, and one instance of L7ID, the instruction decoder.
These two modules are connected by the Lab_6 main module, Lab_6.v, found here: https://github.com/SamMKilsdonk/CA_L6
The testbench is L7TB.v.
